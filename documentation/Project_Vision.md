## Product Vision

### Primary Questions
* **What is the product to be developed? What type of system it will be (e.g. a Web API, a Web frontend, a mobile app, a desktop app?) and what will the system allow its users to achieve?**
  - The product will be a web application which will calculate necessary drainage-related parameters like catchment area size and river system length at the user's desired point to automate the work of environmental scientists, landscape planners and hydraulic engineers and make it more percise. This will be the first of it's kind in Estonia.
* **What makes this product different from competing products?**
  - It will differ from other competing products by being Estonia specific and automatically calculating the desired parameters instead of making the user calculate them themself.
* **Why should customers buy this product? What problem it will solve or what opportunity is it meant to exploit?** 
  - The customers should buy this project to not only save up time needed to calculate the parameters but also make the calculation more percise. Right now, if an environmental engineer wants to know the drainage parameters of a certain spot, they would have to search for data from multiple different databases and then make a calculation which involves a lot of summarizations and "eye-balling". This will be solved by making the application search for all the necessary parameters and making the calculations.
* **Who are the target customers and users?**
  - Target customers and users include: environmental researchers and scientists; various engineers; construction consultants; city designers and planners.

### Moore's template
**FOR** hydraulic engineers, environmental scientists, and researchers at both the public and private sector involved in drainage and water management **WHO** need an automated tool to calculate key drainage-related parameters at a coordinate point. **THE** hydrological parameters calculator **THAT** will greatly streamline hydrological assessments for drainage and water management purposes. **UNLIKE** the current situation where obtaining these parameters requires manual input and analysis, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, **OUR** hydrological parameters calculator will take human-error out of the process and make it faster by utilizing the existing geospatial datasets and -bases to calculate relevant parameters such as catchment area size, river system length, average slope of the catchment, land use characteristics and much more.
