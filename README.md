# HydroCalc

1. Product Vision:
   
FOR hydraulic engineers, environmental scientists, and researchers at both the public and private sector involved in drainage and water management WHO need an automated tool to calculate key drainage-related parameters at a coordinate point. THE hydrological parameters calculator THAT will greatly streamline hydrological assessments for drainage and water management purposes. UNLIKE the current situation where obtaining these parameters requires manual input and analysis, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, OUR hydrological parameters calculator will take human-error out of the process and make it faster by utilizing the existing geospatial datasets and -bases to calculate relevant parameters such as catchment area size, river system length, average slope of the catchment, land use characteristics and much more.
