# Hydrological Parameters Calculator

## Product Vision
   
**FOR** hydraulic engineers, environmental scientists, and researchers at both the public and private sector involved in drainage and water management **WHO** need an automated tool to calculate key drainage-related parameters at a coordinate point. **THE** hydrological parameters calculator **THAT** will greatly streamline hydrological assessments for drainage and water management purposes. **UNLIKE** the current situation where obtaining these parameters requires manual input and analysis, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, **OUR** hydrological parameters calculator will take human-error out of the process and make it faster by utilizing the existing geospatial datasets and -bases to calculate relevant parameters such as catchment area size, river system length, average slope of the catchment, land use characteristics and much more.
